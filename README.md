# Macro-Wack

Macro-Wack is a 4 key macropad with 4 keys to keep it simple. It also has 2 WS2812B Leds, and uses kmk firmware

Inspired by the Emerging red colour scheme found in some "No Man's Sky" Living Ships 

## Features:
- A Two part case that will be 3d printed
- 2 WS2812B RGB LEDs. Both will have the ability to glow through the case
- 4 Keys

## CAD Model:
Everything fits together using 4 M3 Bolts and heatset inserts. 4 for the case.

It has 2 separate printed pieces.
The Top/Lid and The Bottom/Case/Base

## Firmware Overview
This hackpad uses kmk firmware for everything. 

- The 4 keys currently act as macros.

I might change the firmware overtime to suit current needs and requirements!

## BOM:
Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad

- 4x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x DSA Keycaps
- 4x M3x5x4 Heatset inserts
- 4x M3x16mm SHCS Bolts
- 2x WS2812B LEDs
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 1x Case (2 printed parts)
